Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_script01_3/Ses05F_script01_3_M027.wav,sad,takes a little time to toss something like that off you know . because  they weren't just men .
Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_script01_3/Ses05F_script01_3_M028.wav,sad,for instance  there's this one time it  had been raining for several days and . this kid came up to me and gave me his last pair of dry socks  you know  he just put them in my pocket .
Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_script01_3/Ses05F_script01_3_M029.wav,sad,i know that that's not a big thing but  it's just the kind of guys i had . they didn't die . they  they killed themselves for each other .
Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_script01_3/Ses05F_script01_3_M030.wav,sad,i mean that exactly that  a little more selfish . and they would have still been here today .
Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_script01_3/Ses05F_script01_3_M031.wav,sad,and i got an ideal . watching them all go down  everything was being destroyed see and .
Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_script01_3/Ses05F_script01_3_M032.wav,sad,but it seemed to me that something  new  was being created at the same time  a kind of  responsibility . man for man do you understand me .
Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_script01_3/Ses05F_script01_3_M033.wav,sad,and  to show that to  to  bring that back onto the earth again  like a like a monument and . everyone would have it standing behind them and and it would  make a difference for them .
Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_script01_3/Ses05F_script01_3_M034.wav,sad,and then i went home and it was  incredible  it had no meaning here .
Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_script01_3/Ses05F_script01_3_M035.wav,sad,it was all like  some kind of . bus accident to them . i went back to work with my dad in that whole rat race again .
Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_script01_3/Ses05F_script01_3_M036.wav,sad,and i felt . what you said . ashamed somehow . because . nobody had changed  at all  it seemed to make suckers out of a whole lot of guys . and .
Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_script01_3/Ses05F_script01_3_M037.wav,sad,it felt wrong to be alive  to  open that bank book  to buy that new car to look at that new refrigerator i mean . you can take those things out of the war but . if you drive that car . you have to know that that comes from the love that a man has for a man . and you've got to be a little bit better than that .
Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_script01_3/Ses05F_script01_3_M039.wav,hap,i i want you now annie .

Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_script02_1/Ses05F_script02_1_M019.wav,hap,think about people in kansas they have to get  a a plane reservation and a hotel reservation just to see this uh but we are just forty minutes away . too good to pass up .
Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_script02_1/Ses05F_script02_1_M020.wav,hap,yeah but  that moment on the beach is the highlight of their little lives  all that flopping around is . laying eggs or . what . you mating or spawning or something like that .
Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_script02_1/Ses05F_script02_1_M021.wav,hap,this is a big night for these guys life's last orgy . yeah .

Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_script02_1/Ses05F_script02_1_M032.wav,hap,it's just some little  instinctual time release firecracker that went off inside them and all this one  they turn around and form a line as  long as the california coast and just started swimming .
Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_script02_1/Ses05F_script02_1_M033.wav,hap,they are swimming right now as if it's the only thing that matters it's  it's . single mindedness with no mind urgency that's pure urge  it's  they don't know what drives them they . they don't give any name or ask any question . they just turn as one and started to swim to the very point we are standing right now  for a massive celebration of sex and  death . god it's giving me goose bumps all over my hairs on . my arm  popping up .
