Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_3/Ses02F_script01_3_M025.wav,sad,just about all .
Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_3/Ses02F_script01_3_M026.wav,sad,it takes some time for a guy to . toss that off . cause they weren't  just men .
Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_3/Ses02F_script01_3_M027.wav,sad,for instance one time it  had been raining several days and this kid came to me and . gave me his last pair of dry socks  i put them in pocket  it's only a little thing but  that's the kind of guys i had .
Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_3/Ses02F_script01_3_M028.wav,sad,they didn't die . they killed themselves for each other  i mean that exactly a  little more selfish and they'd have been here today .
Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_3/Ses02F_script01_3_M029.wav,sad,i got this idea . watching them go down . everything was being destroyed see but . it seemed that there was one new thing being made a . sort of  responsibility  man for man .

Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_3/Ses02F_script01_3_M032.wav,sad,and i felt what you said . ashamed somehow . cause nobody was changed at all it  seemed to make suckers out of a lot of guys  i felt wrong to be alive  to . open the new bank book . drive the new car see the new refrigerator .
Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_3/Ses02F_script01_3_M033.wav,sad,i mean you can take those things out of a war but . when you drive that car you've  gotta know that it . came out of the love a man can have for a man . you've gotta be a little better because of it .
Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_3/Ses02F_script01_3_M034.wav,sad,because otherwise all you have is . really loot . and . there's blood on it and  i didn't want to take any of it and  i guess that included you .
