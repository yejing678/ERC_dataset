Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_3/Ses02F_script01_3_M033.wav,sad,i mean you can take those things out of a war but . when you drive that car you've  gotta know that it . came out of the love a man can have for a man . you've gotta be a little better because of it .
Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_3/Ses02F_script01_3_M034.wav,sad,because otherwise all you have is . really loot . and . there's blood on it and  i didn't want to take any of it and  i guess that included you .

Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_impro04/Ses02M_impro04_F000.wav,neu,so how you feeling .
Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_impro04/Ses02M_impro04_F001.wav,neu,you've been doing a lot of work for it right .
Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_impro04/Ses02M_impro04_F002.wav,neu,right so the fact you doing the best that you can is .
Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_impro04/Ses02M_impro04_F003.wav,neu,you know you shouldn't give yourself a hard time for that it's  the best you can .
Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_impro04/Ses02M_impro04_F004.wav,neu,well but you care about what you do right .
Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_impro04/Ses02M_impro04_F005.wav,neu,i understand that it's so frustrating but . i know that you're here because you really want it you know . and and  uh .
Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_impro04/Ses02M_impro04_F006.wav,neu,well i  mean you're still here you've tried for this long so i think that says something all in itself .
Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_impro04/Ses02M_impro04_F007.wav,neu,you are persistence  i mean that's important that's .
Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_impro04/Ses02M_impro04_F008.wav,neu,well  you're talented so  keep that in mind you know you shouldn't give yourself too hard of a time .
Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_impro04/Ses02M_impro04_F009.wav,sad,i'm sorry .
Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_impro04/Ses02M_impro04_F010.wav,neu,that's  i mean  there are more factors then just  whether you're  good or not you know what i mean like .
Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_impro04/Ses02M_impro04_F011.wav,neu,and the fact that  you know there is always different types of things and what  kind of . people they want in the office and whether it's male or female or you know what i mean like things  are out of your control .
Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_impro04/Ses02M_impro04_F012.wav,neu,so you should take that in consideration rather than giving yourself such a hard time .
Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_impro04/Ses02M_impro04_F014.wav,neu,you know and  the fact  you still here and . still cooking like  it's good that you're thinking about it that you're reconsidering .
Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_impro04/Ses02M_impro04_F015.wav,neu,but like . just because you're considering  why it's been so difficult doesn't mean you should just stop .
Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_impro04/Ses02M_impro04_F016.wav,neu,maybe you should take a little break from it but i don't think you should stop .
Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_impro04/Ses02M_impro04_M014.wav,sad,i don't know it's just not . i don't know i don't know what to do really you  know i'm just thinking .
Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_impro04/Ses02M_impro04_M019.wav,ang,this doesn't happen . to a normal person .
Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_impro04/Ses02M_impro04_M022.wav,sad,right thanks for . talking to me .
Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_impro05/Ses02M_impro05_F000.wav,neu,hi can i help you .
Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_impro05/Ses02M_impro05_F001.wav,neu,oh did you check did you make sure as it went around the second time that it .
Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_impro05/Ses02M_impro05_F002.wav,neu,okay well um the f .
Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_impro05/Ses02M_impro05_F003.wav,neu,actually i'm looking here at the information  the flight that you were on we had some  trouble with  some . of the baggage it looks like a few peoples bags didn't make it through  um  so .
Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_impro05/Ses02M_impro05_F004.wav,neu,well you can fill out this paperwork  um and if for some reason it shows up  we can bring it to you but .
Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_impro05/Ses02M_impro05_F005.wav,neu,well . sometimes it's just . late baggage or misplaced baggage and . it comes out . but it  seems to be here and just i'm reading off of this that .
Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_impro05/Ses02M_impro05_F006.wav,neu,uh  it . didn't make it into the second plane so it looks like  there  they don't actually know what happened to it .
Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_impro05/Ses02M_impro05_F007.wav,neu,um well sometimes there is just difficulties with loading on to the plane  uh  there can be a theft  or . uh some sort of . you know  mishap  with a cart or something .
Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_impro05/Ses02M_impro05_F008.wav,neu,i  i . i understand but um .
Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_impro05/Ses02M_impro05_F009.wav,neu,okay .
Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_impro05/Ses02M_impro05_F010.wav,neu,right .
Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_impro05/Ses02M_impro05_F011.wav,neu,i understand that um so i'm going to put down here that you looking for your baggage  but we actually . can't . uh . this bag  is . likely not going to show up so what we're going to do .
Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_impro05/Ses02M_impro05_F012.wav,neu,sometimes it gets stolen  sometimes it gets misplaced on another plane  and .
Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_impro05/Ses02M_impro05_F013.wav,neu,they they  it . gets shipped to somewhere else and then it's  stuck somewhere and then we have no way of tracking that .
Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_impro05/Ses02M_impro05_F014.wav,neu,so we'll what we'll  do .
Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_impro05/Ses02M_impro05_F015.wav,neu,right . like i  said sometimes a  theft and things happen like that but we are willing to reim  reimburse you .
Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_impro05/Ses02M_impro05_F016.wav,neu,um so .
Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_impro05/Ses02M_impro05_F017.wav,neu,we have very tight security but we uh . there are times when  we just can't uh  make sure there aren't absolutely no human  error you know .
Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_impro05/Ses02M_impro05_F018.wav,neu,i'm . sorry there is no guarantee on baggage .
Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_impro05/Ses02M_impro05_F019.wav,neu,i understand so .
Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_impro05/Ses02M_impro05_F020.wav,neu,all right we've already checked . back here for your baggage .
Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_impro05/Ses02M_impro05_F021.wav,neu,and  we will continue to look for it and . because your paper .
Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_impro05/Ses02M_impro05_F023.wav,neu,well it's it's just sort of help with the fact uh that . you lost some of your possessions and we rather do that than .
Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_impro05/Ses02M_impro05_F024.wav,neu,the airline . can't afford to give you . everything that is in that suitcase . and  so .
Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_impro05/Ses02M_impro05_F025.wav,neu,well because lots of people get their baggage  lost and we don't want to have  false  claims or anything like that so  we have .
Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_impro05/Ses02M_impro05_F026.wav,neu,we can give you fifty dollar to sort of  make up for it to compensate . and we can definitely let you know if it shows up but  likely . more than likely .
Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_impro05/Ses02M_impro05_M000.wav,neu,hi . um .
Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_impro05/Ses02M_impro05_M001.wav,neu,it  seems that uh my my bag didn't make it out on the . carousel .

Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_3/Ses03M_script01_3_M040.wav,sad,cause you can take those things out of the war  but you got to know  when you drive that car that it came out of the love that a man can have for a man and you got to be a little bit better because of that .
Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_3/Ses03M_script01_3_M041.wav,sad,otherwise what you have is loot . and there's blood on it .
